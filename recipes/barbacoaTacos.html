    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="contentText">
        <li>1 small white onion, quartered</li>
        <li>2 ripe plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="contentText">
        <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high. Arrange onion wedges (cut side down), tomatoes, and garlic
            in the dry skillet in a single layer, working in batches if needed. Cook, turning occasionally, until
            charred on
            all sides, about 6 minutes for the garlic and about 12 minutes for the onions and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Transfer charred vegetables to a blender and add chipotle peppers. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Stir together salt, chili powder, cumin, and black pepper in a small bowl. Cut beef into 6 equal-sized cubes
            and season evenly with salt mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef in batches and cook, turning occasionally, until
            browned on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer browned beef to a large plate.</li>
        <li>Pour water into the Dutch oven and scrape up any browued bits from the bottom of the pan. Add onion-tomato
            mixture, bay leaves, oregano, and brown sugar and stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring to a
            simmer.</li>
        <li>Nestle beef back into pot and cover. Cook, stirring and re-nestling beef occasionally (about every 20 to 30
            minutes), until beef is tender and pulls easily apart with a fork, 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours and 15
            minutes. Remove bay leaves and discard.</li>
        <li>Remove beef from Dutch oven, place on cutting board; shred beef using 2 forks. Return beef to the Dutch
            oven, add lime juice, and stir to combine. Serve in corn tortillas with cilantro, radishes, and avocado.
        </li>
