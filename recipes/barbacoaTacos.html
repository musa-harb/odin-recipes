    <h2>Barbacoa Tacos</h2>
    <p>This meat for these barbacoa tacos is packed with smoky chile pepper flavor and comes out perfectly tender.
        Spices like cumin complement the chiles and oregano and bay leaves add an earthiness to this recipe.</p>
    <p>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high. Arrange onion wedges (cut side down), tomatoes, and garlic in the
        dry skillet in a single layer, working in batches if needed. Cook, turning occasionally, until charred on all
        sides, about 6 minutes for the garlic and about 12 minutes for the onions and tomatoes.</p>

        <li>1 small white onion, quartered</li>
